### Minicraft Potato Edition
A demake of Minicraft that features infinite terrain generation. This project is developed in Python using `pygame-ce` (Pygame Community Edition).

The original Minicraft was created by Markus Persson (Notch) in Java for the Ludum Dare 22 competition

**Currently this project is in full development, so it is no surprise that the code is not a big deal :(**
