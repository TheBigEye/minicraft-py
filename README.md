# Minicraft Potato Edition

> **Note:** This project is currently in active development; the code is still in progress. ðŸ™ƒ

A remake of the classic Minicraft, originally created by **Markus Persson** (Notch) in Java for the **Ludum Dare 22 competition**. This project is developed in Python using `pygame-ce` (Pygame Community Edition).

## Current Features
- **Infinite terrain generation** based on chunks
- **Mobs with pathfinding**
- **Chunk region-based saving system** (inspired by MCRegion)
- **Day and night cycle**
- **Chunk updates** and spreading of water and grass
- **Biomes** defined by temperature and humidity

## Planned Features
- Final Boss
- Inventory and items
- Tools and weapons
- Background music
- A redstone-like system (perhaps wires?)
- Mountains, caves, and ores to mine
- Achievements
- Potions
- Hunger and Armor
- Structures
- And more...

## Why *Potato Edition*?
- Because, theoretically, even a potato could run this game. ðŸ¥”
- The goal is to create a lightweight, optimized game with old-school graphics and effects.
